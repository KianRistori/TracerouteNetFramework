# TracerouteNetFramework

This program is written in C# and uses the .NET Ping class to perform a traceroute to a specified host. The program starts by declaring some static variables, including a boolean "d" and two integers "maxTTL" and "maxMS", which represent the maximum number of hop points and maximum timeout in milliseconds for each response, respectively. In the Main method, the user is prompted to enter a command, which is then processed by a method called "CommandReserch". The main method of the program is "GetTraceRoute", which uses the Ping class to send ICMP packets to a specified host and print the routing path to the host. The program also uses the Dns class to resolve IP addresses to hostnames, unless the "-d" parameter is specified at runtime. The program continues to repeat command processing until it is manually interrupted.
